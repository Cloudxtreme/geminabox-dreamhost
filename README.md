# Gem In A Box on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?239314) shared hosting

This repo has the basic code for you to run Gem In A Box on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?239314) shared hosting.

## Installation

1) Create a new domain/subdomain in [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?239314) shared hosting control panel for the gem server make sure that you checked the Passenger (Ruby/Python apps only) option. You must also specify the location of the 'public' subdirectory of the Ruby on Rails (or other Rack-compliant) application at the same time which is just public.

2) SSH to your server and cd to the folder of the domain/subdomain.

3) Clone this repo locally or directly to your [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?239314) shared hosting domain/subdomain you wish to have the gem server.

	git clone https://github.com/shukydvir/geminabox-dreamhost.git
	
4) Update the config.ru file with your username and password for the basic authentication or comment these lines if you don't wise no authentication at all.

	use Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|
	  username = 'username'
	  password = 'password'
	end
	
5) if you have cloned localy you need to upload the files to the server (choose which method you want rsync, scp, etcâ€¦.)

6) run bundle install on the server.

	bundle install
	
if that don't work you need to export the path of the gems on your server should be like this:

	export PATH=~/.gems/bin:/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/bin:$PATH
	
and then run bundle install.

7) you need to restart the passenger in order for the settings to take place.

	touch tmp/restart.txt
	
will get the job done.

## Usage

if you did other changes in the code you need to restart the passenger by doing

	touch tmp/restart.txt
	
	
in order to use this just add this to your Gemfile

	source "http://your.servers.host"
	
or if you setup the basic auth use this

	source "http://username:password@your.servers.host"
	
and you can access your private gems hosted on your own private gem server on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?239314) shared hosting.
